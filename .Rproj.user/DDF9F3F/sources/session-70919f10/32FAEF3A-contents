## Joanna Diong

Joanna is a human movement scientist and physiotherapist with a strong interest in understanding causal mechanisms. Her research focuses on:
1) Applying epidemiological methods to investigate causal questions in motor control, paralysis and pain, and
2) Finding strategies to improve scientific rigour and responsible research practices.

Jo applies computational methods to examine causal mechanisms in clinical and laboratory-based studies. She also conducts 'research on research' to examine problems in current research practices and find ways to promote good science.

She teaches functional musculoskeletal anatomy, with a strong emphasis on movement analysis and functional roles of muscles. She also teaches applied research methods and basic computer programming (Python, Stata). She co-leads the Bias in Research Node at the Charles Perkins Centre, serves as Research Integrity Advisor at The University of Sydney, and as Reviewing Editor for the Journal of Applied Physiology and Physiological Reports.

She has a sustained interest in good scientific practices, and co-writes the blog Scientifically Sound (https://scientificallysound.org/) as a resource on sound science. She could discuss research design and data analysis for a while (probably for too long). She likes dark chocolate and strong tea.

## Philip Clare

Philip is a Biostatistician, with a PhD in Biostatistics from UNSW Sydney and a Masters in Biostatistics from the University of Sydney. He currently works as a Biostatistician for the Prevention Research Collaboration at the University of Sydney, and is an Adjunct Lecturer with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. He also conducts methodological research, with a particular focus on causal inference using observational data, and the use of machine learning in causal inference.

Philip completed his PhD in 2020, with a focus on the use of targeted maximum likelihood estimation to estimate causal effects, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Timothy Dobbins, Prof. Richard Mattick and Assoc. Prof. Raimondo Bruno.
