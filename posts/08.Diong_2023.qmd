Aimed to estimate the causal effect of face-to-face learning on student performance in anatomy, compared to online learning,
by analysing exam marks under an assumed causal structure.

* Under this DAG, the causal effect holds if the paths from COVID lockdown to end-sem exam mark are fully mitigated (blocked) by the mid-sem exam mark and feedback
* Interestingly, this mean the causal effect could only be identified (and estimated) by analysing the end-sem mark alone, not the combined mid- and end-sem mark (analysing the combined mark would bias the causal effect, under this DAG)
* ATAR scores (high school marks) are also not a confounder and should not be adjusted in the analysis

## Paper 8.

* We reported E-values for sensitivity analysis, and interpreted them in Discussion
  * This is the minimum strength of association (risk with confounding / risk without confounding) that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with an exposure and an outcome to completely explain away the exposure-outcome association, conditional on the adjusted vairables
  * E-value of 1 is the null effect: no unmeasured confounding is needed to explain away the causal effect (this is bad)

## Paper 8.

Comments:

* Provide evidence to justify DAG: reviewers will ask for it.
* The total causal effect, not the direct causal effect, is the preferred estimate: The total effect includes mediation paths, requires fewer assumptions, and is the default effect reported in the literature
