Causal effects can be stated in terms of the potential outcomes framework (Rubin) or
'blocking backdoor paths' using do-calculus to identify the causal effect (Pearl)

Individual causal effects can't be observed.
But under certain assumptions, average causal effects can be identified and estimated using data.

'Exchangeability' between groups (i.e. no unmeasured confounding) is an important assumption.
Other assumptions are:

* causal consistency: There is only one version of treatment, or if not, any differences remaining between treatments are irrelevant
* positivity: There are exposed and control individuals at every combination of covariates
* and the causal model is correctly specified

Causal inferences can be weak or strong, depending on how valid those assumptions are.

## Paper 4.

Randomisation is good:
It generates causal effects because it breaks the confounder -> outcome path.

If randomisation is not feasible, try to approximate exchangeability using subject matter knowledge and good data:
specify plausible causal mechanisms in a DAG to identify the minimally-sufficient adjustment set.

Then interpret estimates as causal effects of exposure on outcome under the assumed DAG.

## Discussion

Comments or clarifications?

What other variable adjustment methods are there when a DAG is impossibly complicated (e.g. genetics data)?

What other variable adjustment methods are there when a DAG is impossibly complicated (e.g. genetics data)?

What are the best sorts of exposures to investigate: modifiable or non-modifiable?

What are challenges in specifically defining exposures?
