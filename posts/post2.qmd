# Paper 2. Lipsky AM, Greenland S. Causal directed acyclic graphs.

### Access at: [doi:10.1001/jama.2022.1816](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.1816)

A causal directed acyclic graph

-   shows direction of plausible causal effects between exposure, outcome and other variables

-   has directed (e.g. E -\> O, E -\> M -\> O) and non-directed (e.g. E \<- C -\> O, E -\> S \<- O) paths

-   is complete when it includes any variable that has arrows into each possible pair of variables along paths from cause to effect

## Paper 2.

-   Association flows along directed and non-directed paths

-   Causal association only flows along directed paths

-   To identify (then estimate) causal associations, block all non-directed (backdoor) paths

-   Do this by

    -   adjusting/conditioning on confounders

    -   leaving colliders alone

## Discussion

Any comments or clarifications? Terms:

-   exposure/treatment

-   assumption

-   (statistical) adjustment/conditioning/control

Sometimes, a variable can be both a confounder and a collider. Special methods are needed to deal with this.

Sometimes, conditioning on colliders can happen inadvertently (e.g. loss of participants before study completion forces analysis to condition on selection of participants). Methods are needed to deal with selection bias.

1.  In practice, how do you build a DAG?

2.  What have reviewers challenged when reviewing DAGs?

3.  How do you know a DAG is correct?
