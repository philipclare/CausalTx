* An 'association' between exposure and outcome is only useful when if it is causal or predictive
* 'No causation without manipulation' means it is not possible to talk meaningfully about causal effects of an exposure unless it's clear how the exposure can be manipulated
* Theory drives analysis of aetiology by suggesting
  * plausible confounders
  * if exposure-outcome relationships may be non-linear
  * if there are interactions between exposures or
  * if exposures are mediators

## Discussion

Comments or clarifications?

How might including strong confounders in prognostic models improve generalisability? \
When is a confounder 'strong'?

Isn't the aim of prediction to estimate the expectation of the outcome in those with and without the predictor?
(Which, in causal inference, is analogous to contrasting the outcomes in those with and without the exposure)
