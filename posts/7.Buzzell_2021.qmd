Aimed to estimate excess deaths caused by different mechanisms of non-traumatic SCI
(e.g. degenerative disc disorder, infection, vascular disorder, benign tumour, malignant tumour)
from deaths caused by lesion-related (SCI severity) or demographic factors (age, sex, calendar period)
using deaths in traumatic SCI as the reference

* Exposure: SCI etiology (cause)
* Outcome: survival time
* Latent (unobserved) variable: underlying health conditions that cause (non-traumatic) SCI
* Confounders: age, sex, calendar period
* Mediator: SCI severity (included in the _total causal effect_)

## Paper 7.

* Conditional dependencies in the fairly simple DAG were tested to confirm DAG is consistent with dataset
* Relative mortality estimated with hazard ratios
* Sensitivity analysis:
  * Compared traumatic SCi mortality caused by 'transport related' + 'sports and leisure' alone, vs these + 'falls' and 'other'
  * E-values calculated: indicates the magnitude (as risk ratio) of unmeasured confounding needed to be associated with exposure and outcome to completely explain away the causal effect; big E-value risk ratio is better

## Discussion

Comments or clarifications?

Dashed/dotted arrows in DAG is non-standard

SCI severity is a mediator: its effect can't be teased out from total causal effect without mediation analysis

How important is it to test for conditional independencies?
(Less feasible in complex DAG, prone to Type 1 error, DAG should be based on theory not testability, testing can't externally validate DAG, RMSE hard to interpret?)



1. Specify knowledge about the system to be studied using a causal model
2. Specify the observed data and their link to the causal model
3. Specify a target causal quantity
4. Assess identifiability
5. State the statistical estimation problem
6. Estimate
7. Interpret

## Comments

This paper provides a framework to articulate a causal question and answer it using statistical approaches.

There are many 'versions' of causal roadmaps, with steps in slightly different orders.
Most causal inference courses, beginner and advanced, will reference a roadmap.
The bottom line is, use one of the roadmaps to draft a study protocol to stop from getting lost/confused.

Suggestions:

* See Dang and Balzer 2013 commentary
* Do an online course through SER: https://epiresearch.org/
* Do an online course through Harvard CausaLab summer school: https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/2024-causal-courses/

## Discussion

Do you think all steps in the framework exist independently, or occur simultaneously?

Are some steps more important or less practical than others?

How can language to interpret causal effects reflect the strength of scientific claims?
