1. Specify knowledge about the system to be studied using a causal model
2. Specify the observed data and their link to the causal model
3. Specify a target causal quantity
4. Assess identifiability
5. State the statistical estimation problem
6. Estimate
7. Interpret

## Comments

This paper provides a framework to articulate a causal question and answer it using statistical approaches.

There are many 'versions' of causal roadmaps, with steps in slightly different orders.
Most causal inference courses, beginner and advanced, will reference a roadmap.
The bottom line is, use one of the roadmaps to draft a study protocol to stop from getting lost/confused.

Suggestions:

* See Dang and Balzer 2013 commentary
* Do an online course through SER: https://epiresearch.org/
* Do an online course through Harvard CausaLab summer school: https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/2024-causal-courses/

## Discussion

Do you think all steps in the framework exist independently, or occur simultaneously?

Are some steps more important or less practical than others?

How can language to interpret causal effects reflect the strength of scientific claims?
