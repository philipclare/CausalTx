Joanna is a human movement scientist and physiotherapist with a strong interest in understanding causal mechanisms. Her research focuses on 3 key areas:\
1) Applying epidemiological methods to investigate causal questions in health and disease,\
2) Using modern statistical approaches to investigate structure and function in human neurophysiology, and\
3) Finding strategies to improve scientific rigour and responsible research practices.\
\
Jo applies computational methods to examine causal mechanisms in clinical and laboratory-based studies. She also conducts 'research on research' to examine problems in current research practices and find ways to promote good science.\
\
She teaches functional musculoskeletal anatomy, with a strong emphasis on movement analysis and functional roles of muscles. She also teaches applied research methods and basic computer programming (Python, Stata). She co-leads the Bias in Research Node at the Charles Perkins Centre, serves as Research Integrity Advisor at The University of Sydney, and as Reviewing Editor for the journal Physiological Reports.\
\
She has a sustained interest in good scientific practices, and co-writes the blog Scientifically Sound (https://scientificallysound.org/) as a resource on sound science. She could discuss research design and data analysis for a while (probably for too long). She likes dark chocolate and strong tea.
